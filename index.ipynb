    "### **Background on projectile motion**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is given an initial velocity and is affected by gravitational acceleration and air resistance, it follows a specific path known as projectile motion. Athletes often perform this type of movement in sports like baseball, football, and shooting. The trajectory of a projectile is the path it takes while in motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze projectile motion, an idealized model is often used. This model assumes that the projectile is a particle with constant acceleration due to gravity, disregarding factors like air resistance, earth's curvature, and rotation. While this model has limitations, it still provides valuable insights into projectile motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projectile motion occurs in a vertical plane defined by the initial velocity's direction. Gravity purely affects the projectile's motion in the vertical direction, restricting it to two dimensions. The xy-coordinate plane is where the motion occurs, with the x-axis horizontal and the y-axis vertical. This results in a parabolic trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "![parabolic](images/parabolic_path.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to analyzing projectile motion is treating the horizontal and vertical coordinates as separate components. The horizontal and vertical motions are independent, with the former having a constant velocity and the latter experiencing a constant downward acceleration of -g (where g is positive in the chosen coordinate system). By treating the motion as a combination of the two components, we can express the projectile's position, velocity, and acceleration as separate equations for the horizontal and vertical motions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the independence of perpendicular motion. An object dropped from rest will reach the ground at the same time as an object thrown horizontally from the same height.\n",
    "\n",
    "![independence](images/independence.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the acceleration is constant we can use the kinematic equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Kinematic Equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the acceleration is -g in the y-direction and 0 in the x-direction. The kinematic equations in terms of x are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x(t) = x_0 + v_{x0}t + \\frac{1}{2}a_xt^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_x(t) = v_{x0} + a_xt$\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Velocity Squared:\n",
    "   - $v_x^2 = v_{x0}^2 + 2a_x(x-x_0)$\n",
    "   - This equation calculates the velocity squared (v_x^2) of an object by adding the initial velocity squared (v_i_x^2) to twice the acceleration (a_x) multiplied by the displacement (x-x_0).\n",

    "4. Velocity:\n",
    "   - $v_x = \\frac{x-x_0}{t}$\n",
    "   - This equation calculates the velocity (v_x) of an object by dividing the displacement (x-x_0) by the time (t) taken.\n",

    "### Importance of numerical simulations in studying projectile motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Projectile motion is often taught as a fundamental concept in physics education to help students learn about motion and gravity. This involves launching objects into the air and observing their curved paths, which gravity influences solely. However, projectile motion can become more complex when it comes to realistic calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges with projectile motion is the absence of a straightforward analytical solution. Projectile motion lacks a closed-form solution Unlike other problems with precise equations describing position, velocity, and acceleration as time functions. This is due to the inclusion of air resistance, which significantly impacts the object's trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When air resistance cannot be ignored, calculating the trajectory becomes more challenging because the effects of air resistance are velocity-dependent. As a result, the acceleration is no longer constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately model and predict projectile motion, computer simulations are essential. Simulations use numerical integration methods to solve the equations of motion, accounting for gravity, air resistance, and other relevant forces. Simulations provide a step-by-step approximation of the projectile's motion by discretizing time and iteratively updating the object's position and velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations have several advantages when dealing with the complexities of realistic projectile motion. They allow for incorporating intricate mathematical models that consider the changing effects of air resistance as the object moves through the air. Additionally, simulations provide a flexible framework for exploring different scenarios by adjusting launch angles, initial velocities, and environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations provided by simulations enhance the understanding of projectile behavior. Dynamic plots of trajectory, velocity, and other relevant quantities over time show how factors like air resistance impact the projectile's path. This visual feedback fosters a comprehensive comprehension of the complex behavior exhibited by projectiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations can also encompass more complex scenarios involving multiple projectiles or interactions with obstacles, allowing for exploring various strategies, such as optimizing launch parameters to achieve specific objectives like maximum range or height."
